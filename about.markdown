# Hi! I'm Alexandr Samoilenko
DevOps Engineer with a strong background in managing and enhancing infrastructure for prominent financial institutions. Over the years, I have honed my skills in orchestrating and optimizing Kubernetes clusters, deploying and maintaining various infrastructure services, and implementing robust CI/CD methodologies. My expertise extends to infrastructure as code using tools like Terraform and Ansible, as well as scripting in Python.
